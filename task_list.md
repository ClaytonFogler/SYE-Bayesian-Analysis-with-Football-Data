2.  Apply bagging and random forests to the football play data!

3.  Modify the introduction to incorporate coach conversation (personnel).

### For October 23

1.  Add data from first 5 games.

2.  Learn about bagging and random forests. <https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/bagging.html> and <https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/random-forest.html>

3.  Apply bagging and random forests to the football play data!

<https://stat2labs.sites.grinnell.edu/Handouts/rtutorials/ClassificationTrees.html>

<https://fderyckel.github.io/machinelearningwithr/trees-and-classification.html>

<https://bookdown.org/jhvdz1/ml2/classification-decision-trees.html>

2.  Apply a classification tree to your data!

### For October 2

1.  Look into the formations more. Combine any that are similar; drop any that don't make sense to include (SPIKE). Add descriptions of each to the write-up.

*2. Try out some interaction terms and practice interpreting the interaction terms.*

*3. Add a count variable onto the heatmap plot.*

*4. Make some exploratory bar plots of predictors and success and plug in some other variables to the heatmap.*

#### For September 25

1.  Try distance as quantitative and adjust the plot.

2.  Look into the formations more. Combine any that are similar; drop any that don't make sense to include (SPIKE). Add descriptions of each to the write-up.

3.  heatmap with `geom_tile()`. See code from email.

#### For September 18

1.  Start on write-up, writing up part of an introduction and maybe giving some exploratory tables and descriptions.

2.  Fit a logistic regression model with some candidate predictors and explore interactions.

3.  See if you can visualize the model <https://highamm.github.io/dataviz334/09-logistic.html>.

later: heat map for idea 1.

#### For September 11

1.  Download all of 2024 season's games and combine into a single data frame (with a label for each opponent).

2.  Exploration of Idea \# 2, looking at, for example pass vs. run success in a few particular situations or, whether certain formations are associated with more success, etc.

#### For September 4

1.  Download data from HUDL to a .csv or some other suitable file format.

2.  Do some exploratory data analysis on the downloaded data.

3.  Loop through the different plays on HUDL to download data for an entire game.
