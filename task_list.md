## Task List

### For December 11

1. Have a rough draft of the write-up written (push by 12:30 pm on Thursday).

2. On Thursday, make some edits based on what we talk about might be missing (get those to me by Friday at noon).

3. MH: reads in detail on Friday, gives comments by end-of-day Friday.

4. CF: Incorporate comments into final version and send by end-of-day Monday.


### For December 4

1. Remove situation from models.

2. Tweak logistic regression plots to have one probability per distance.

3. Change the classification to do 5-fold cross-validation.

4. Add more games.

5. Work on combining things into a write-up.

### For November 13

1. Fix the bagging and random forest to use a character or factor response.

2. Make training data the same for each of the four methods.

3. Find the classification rate for each of the four methods on the test data.

### For November 6

1. Fix the bagging and random forest to use a character or factor response.

2. Start comparing the four different models: which predictors are best in each? What would you conclude from each?

3. Start incorporating some exploratory graphs into the write-up.

### For October 30

1.  Learn about bagging and random forests. <https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/bagging.html> and <https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/random-forest.html>

2.  Apply bagging and random forests to the football play data!

3.  Modify the introduction to incorporate coach conversation (personnel).

### For October 23

1.  Add data from first 5 games.

2.  Learn about bagging and random forests. <https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/bagging.html> and <https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/random-forest.html>

3.  Apply bagging and random forests to the football play data!

### For October 9 (10/14)

1.  Learn about classification trees.

<https://stat2labs.sites.grinnell.edu/Handouts/rtutorials/ClassificationTrees.html>

<https://fderyckel.github.io/machinelearningwithr/trees-and-classification.html>

<https://bookdown.org/jhvdz1/ml2/classification-decision-trees.html>

2.  Apply a classification tree to your data!

### For October 2

1.  Look into the formations more. Combine any that are similar; drop any that don't make sense to include (SPIKE). Add descriptions of each to the write-up.

*2. Try out some interaction terms and practice interpreting the interaction terms.*

*3. Add a count variable onto the heatmap plot.*

*4. Make some exploratory bar plots of predictors and success and plug in some other variables to the heatmap.*

#### For September 25

1.  Try distance as quantitative and adjust the plot.

2.  Look into the formations more. Combine any that are similar; drop any that don't make sense to include (SPIKE). Add descriptions of each to the write-up.

3.  heatmap with `geom_tile()`. See code from email.

#### For September 18

1.  Start on write-up, writing up part of an introduction and maybe giving some exploratory tables and descriptions.

2.  Fit a logistic regression model with some candidate predictors and explore interactions.

3.  See if you can visualize the model <https://highamm.github.io/dataviz334/09-logistic.html>.

later: heat map for idea 1.

#### For September 11

1.  Download all of 2024 season's games and combine into a single data frame (with a label for each opponent).

2.  Exploration of Idea \# 2, looking at, for example pass vs. run success in a few particular situations or, whether certain formations are associated with more success, etc.

#### For September 4

1.  Download data from HUDL to a .csv or some other suitable file format.

2.  Do some exploratory data analysis on the downloaded data.

3.  Loop through the different plays on HUDL to download data for an entire game.
